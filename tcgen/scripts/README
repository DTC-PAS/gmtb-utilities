The purpose of TC genesis verification:

This verification  is currently done to match as closely as possible the way NHC verifies their Tropical Weather Outlook forecasts. For our purposes, we consider the model forecast genesis time/location to be the first entry where our genesis criteria are met.  This may be analogous to the first entry in Tim Marchok's tracker. The code follows these steps:

- Remove any model genesis forecasts whose forecast genesis time is at forecast hour 000. We assume these are existing TCs - not forecasts of TC genesis.

- For each model genesis forecast, find all entries in the best-track (ATCF b-decks) that (i) have a time stamp that matches the valid time of the model genesis forecast and (ii) have a lat/lon within 5 degrees of the model indicated TC lat/lon at the valid time of the model genesis forecast.

   a. If the initialization time is 0-120 h before the best-track genesis time (defined as first entry of TD or TS in the b-decks), then we have a "hit."
   b. If the initialization time is > 120 h before the best-track genesis time, then we have a false alarm.
   c. If the initialization time is after the best-track genesis time, we discard that forecast.

- If there are no matches in the b-decks, conduct the same steps as above, but instead check for CARQ entries of DB, LO, and WV in the ATCF a-decks.

The users may want to modify these steps to fit your particular application. For example, you may want to require that the model forecast genesis valid time is within 24 h of the best-track genesis time to qualify as a hit.


About the scripts:

- The verification data are in three files:
   a. a file with the first b-deck entry of a TD or TS for each TC (i.e. gentimefinal2016.txt).
   b. a file with all b-deck entries of TD, TS, HU, LO, DB, and WV (i.e. btallfinal2016.txt).
   c. a file with all OFCL a-deck entries for TD, TS, and HU, and all CARQ a-deck entries for LO, DB, and WV (i.e. adecks.txt)

  You can concatenate all of the basins into each file (AL and EP data are included in the example files), but all data included should be from the same year.

- The code was developed for cases in the AL, EP, and CP basins. Therefore, it includes an if statement to check if a TC genesis event in the model occurs in the N and W hemispheres before continuing. This can be modified if you wish to verify genesis forecasts globally.

- The inputs for the code are the three text files attached and a file that lists all of the TG files to be processed. They can be hard-coded near the top of the script, or provided on the command line as arguments.
