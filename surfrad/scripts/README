Purpose: Plot a time series of SURFRAD observations against model data

General Steps and Inputs/Outputs:

**** Process SURFRAD observations ****
First, download necessary SURFRAD observation files from: ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/radiation/surfrad/

The run_ascii2nc.ksh script sets necessary, user-specified environment variables in order to run
the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) ascii2nc tool. Ascii2nc was implemented to allow additional processing 
of observations with high temporal resolution. Ascii2nc will read the SURFRAD data in ascii format
and output a NetCDF file with time summary information, which is then read into the NCL code described below.
MET capabilities for processing data over a user specificed time window was enhanced in version 7.1. Prior to 
that version, only a time-centered approach (e.g., +/- 3 hr) was an option. With version 7.1 and beyond, users
now have additional options to specify the time window (e.g., 6 hr prior window). With this change came additional
modifications in the file output format. If running prior to v7.1, please use the older (as noted by the _preMETv7.1)
scripts.

The ascii2nc configuration file requires that several variables be set in the run_ascii2nc.ksh:

Specify grib code of desired radiation variable
 204 = downward shortwave
 205 = downward longwave
 211 = upward shortwave
 212 = upward longwave
For example:
 grib_code=204

Time step - time between intervals in seconds
 time_step_sec=21600

List time widths (is a list, can have multiple entries) - time width of summary intervals in minutes
 time_width_list="360"

Statistic for time summary
 stat="median"

Statistic type low value
 stat_low="min"

Statistic type high value
 stat_high="max"

This example does a 6-hour time summary every 6 hours throughout the day and calulates
the median, min, and max of the SURFRAD data sample.

In addition, the script has several variables to be set depending on the data set:
SURFRAD station list
 stid_list="bon dra fpk gwn psu sxf tbl"

List of initializations to process (can be multiple intializations)
 init_list=2017092500

Length of model forecast
 fcst_length=120

More information on the MET ascii2nc tool can be found in the MET Users' Guide:

**** Create a time series plot of SURFRAD vs model data ****
 - Note, you first must create a processed SURFRAD observation file using the steps described above to output one statistic (e.g., median, mean) and a window of low/high values (e.g., min/max, p10/p90) for one particular variable (e.g., Downward SW radiation flux).

1. Modify run_model_vs_surfrad_plot.ksh
 - Set the following lists depending on what you want to loop through and process:
   - date_list: Initial date you want to plot [Format yyyymmdd (e.g., 20170925)]
   - init_list: Initial hour you want to plot [Format hh (e.g., 00)]
   - twindow_list: Time window that the SURFRAD observations are processed over [in minutes (e.g., 360)]
   - site_list: Stations you want to plot time series at [Format xxx (e.g., dra)]
   - grib_code_lst: Grib code of variables you want to plot [Format ### (e.g., 204)]
      - 204 = downward shortwave
      - 205 = downward longwave
      - 211 = upward shortwave
      - 212 = upward longwave

2. Depending on the length of forecast, you may need to modify the following lines in model_vs_surfrad_plot.ncl 
   - res@tmXBValues = (/0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19/)
   - res@tmXBLabels = (/"06","12", "18", "00", "06", "12", "18", "00", "06", "12", "18", "00", "06", "12", "18", "00", "06", "12", "18", "00"/)
   - res@trXMaxF    = 19

3. Depending on the values of the variable plotted, you may need to modify the following lines in model_vs_surfrad_plot.ncl
   - res@trYMinF    = -50.0
   - res@trYMaxF    = 1250.0
