The purpose of MET-TC verification

The purpose of this tool is to enable users to apply the Model Evaluation Tools - Tropical Cyclone (MET-TC) to
their tropical cyclone datasets and evaluation studies. MET-TC is intended for use with model forecasts run 
through a vortex tracking software or with operational model forecasts in Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast 
(ATCF) file format.

Chapter 17 of MET Version 8.0 (METv8.0) User's Guide provides an overview of MET-TC and detailed information of 
its components. At GMTB, we use prepuild METv8.0 on NOAA's theia machine.


- set up METV8.0 environment on theia:

on theia:
module use /contrib/modulefiles
module load met/8.0
module load nco wgrib R ncview
setenv MET_FONT_DIR /contrib/met/tutorial_data/8.0/fonts/
setenv MET_BASE /contrib/met/8.0/share/met/
setenv RSCRIPTS_BASE $MET_BASE/Rscripts/
setenv MET_INSTALL_DIR /contrib/met/8.0/

- run TC-Pairs

The TC-Pairs tool provides verification for tropical cyclone forecasts in ATCF file format. It 
matches an ATCF format tropical cyclone (TC) forecast with a second ATCF format reference TC dataset 
(most commonly the Best Track analysis)

TC-Pairs tool expects two input data source in order to generate matched pairs and subsequent error statistcs. 
The expected input for MET-TC is an ATCF format file from model output, or the operational aids files with the
operational model output for the 'adeck' and the NHC best track analysis (BEST) for the 'bdeck'. The BEST is 
subjectively smoothed representation of the storm's location and intensity over its lifetime. The track and intensity
values are based on a retrospective assessment of all available observations of the storm
