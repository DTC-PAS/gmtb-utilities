Purpose: plot the probability density function of planetary boundary layer height (PBL height; unit: meter) for different forecast lead times. In this code, the PBL height was from model output, although, in the model, it is determined iteratively and is a function of the horizontal wind speed at the top of the PBL, the virtual potential temperature at the first model level, and the difference in virtual potential temperature between the top of the PBL and the surface. 

Notes: The scripts currently assumed using model output in GRIB1/2 format and were tested using FV3GFSv1 forecasts

General Steps and Inputs/Outputs:

a) edit HPBL.sh as needed
# MMM  : model name
# HHH  : home directory
# XXX  : number of grid in longitude
# YYY  : number of grid in latitude
# SZZ  : number of selected vertical levels for output
# LSZZ : list of selected vertical levels (use grib_dump to check) 
# TTT  : number of total time (in day)
# NBB  : number of basins or regions examined
# LATb : southern bound of latitude of studied domain
# LATe : northern bound of latitude of studied domain
# LONb : western bound of latitude of studied domain
# LONe : eastern bound of latitude of studied domain
# LAT0 : southernmost latitude
# LON0 : westernmost longitude
# GRD  : resolution
# FFF  : number of selected forecast lead times 
# LFF  : list of selected forecast lead times
# BYY  : first year 
# EYY  : last year 
# BMM  : first month
# EMM  : last month
# VPBL : shortname of PBL height in GRIB file
# VLS  : shortname of landmask in GRIB file
# NBIN : number of bins to stratify PBL
# PBL0 : minimum value of PBL
# PBL1 : maximum value of PBL

b) make the script executable:
chmod 754 HPBL.sh

c) run the script:
./HPBL.sh
