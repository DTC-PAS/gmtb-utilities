Info: Scripts developed under the Global T&E Project at Developmental Testbed Center.


Purpose: 

1) zonal_radiation_fluxes.ncl: This script calculates the zonal averages of radiation fluxes at the surface and top of the atmosphere from CERES dataset and multiple GFS global model run outputs.

2) zonal_all_clear_sky_diff.ncl: This script calculates the zonal averages of differences between All-sky and Clear-sky conditions from CERES dataset and multiple GFS global model run outputs.

3) zonal_lwp_iwp.ncl: This script calculates the zonal averages of liquid water path and ice water path from CERES dataset and multiple GFS global run outputs.
