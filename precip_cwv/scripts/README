Authors: Weiwei Li - NCAR/RAL (weiweili@ucar.edu). Some of the code and scripts were also supported by the projects led by Zhuo Wang (zhuowang@illinois.edu)

Purpose: plot the average daily precipitation rate (mm/day), examine the model skill of precipitation (particularly ITCZ) forecasts; and diagnose the relationship between precipitation and column water vapor (CWV). The strong control of CWV on precipitation has been examined in some previous studies (Zeng 1999; Bretherton et al. 2004; Neelin et al. 2009; Alaka and Maloney 2012).

Notes: The scripts currently assumed using model output in GRIB1/2 format and were tested using FV3GFSv1 forecasts

*********************************
General Steps and Inputs/Outputs:

1. analyze model skill of precipitation forecast and ITCZ

a) edit itcz.sh as needed
# !!!!!! What should be modified !!!!!!
# HHH  : home directory
# MMM  : model name
# VVV  : shortname of selected variable (use grib_dump to check)
# XXX  : number of grid in longitude
# YYY  : number of grid in latitude
# XX0  : first longitude in degree
# YY0  : first latitude in degree
# DDX  : x-direction resolution in degree
# DDY  : y-direction resolution in degree
# SZZ  : number of selected vertical levels for output
# LSZZ : list of selected vertical levels (use grib_dump to check) 
# TTT  : number of total time (in day)
# FFF  : number of selected forecast lead times 
# LFF  : list of selected forecast lead times
# BYY  : first year 
# EYY  : last year 
# BMM  : first month
# EMM  : last month

b) make the script executable:
chmod 754 itcz.sh

c) run the script:
./itcz.sh

2. Diagnose the relationship between precipitation and column water vapor (CWV)
